	<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this idiot talking about? Drupal is a content management system; Rails is a framework. Drupal is PHP; Rails is Ruby. The Whitehouse website is built in Drupal!&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>

<p>I hear you. I get it. I&rsquo;ve built university websites in Drupal. It&rsquo;s powerful. It provides a ton of features with the click of a button. It gets you much of what you need without having to touch a line of code.</p>

<p>The problems arise when it comes time to build something that Drupal (or one of its community modules) does not provide. That&rsquo;s when Drupal can get in the way. Any app or website that does anything interesting is going to change over time. There&rsquo;s a point where the platform gets in the way and the costs of using it begin to outweigh the benefits. Sadly, this occurs when it&rsquo;s too late to scrap everything and switch platforms. I have never felt like Ruby on Rails was in my way.</p>

<p>In this post, I show how some of the features that make Drupal a great sell can be implemented in Rails.</p>

<h2>User Registration and Authentication</h2>

<p>Drupal provides this right out of the box. Visitors can make an account and login and logout. Rails doesn&rsquo;t provide this. Luckily, there are multiple libraries - called &ldquo;gems&rdquo; in Ruby - that can be used to add this functionality to your app. Devise is one of them. Here&rsquo;s how to use it.</p>

<p>Add the devise gem to your Gemfile.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'devise'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Install it, and be sure to follow the few additional instructions that display after the installation.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ bundle install
$ rails g devise:install
</code></pre>
<p>Generate a User model.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ rails g devise User
$ rails db:migrate
</code></pre>
<p>You can find links to sign up and sign in at /users/sign_in. You can also restrict anonymous visitors from accessing parts of your app.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ApplicationController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActionController</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="n">before_action</span> <span class="ss">:authenticate_user!</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
<h2>Content Types and Fields</h2>

<p>Drupal provides the ability to create content types with custom fields. It also makes it possible to list, add, edit, view, and delete content. This must require a lot of code in Rails, right? Wrong. Rails provides generators for creating models, controllers, views, and more. Suppose we have a Post content type in Drupal with a title, body. To create something similar in Rails, we can use the scaffold generator.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ rails g scaffold Post title:string body:text
$ rails db:migrate
</code></pre>
<p>The above code creates a Post model (app/models/post.rb), database migration, routes, a controller with actions for adding, editing, viewing, indexing, and deleting posts, and more. If you visit /posts, you&rsquo;ll see links to everything you need. Adding other field types like select menus, enums, and radio buttons requires a little bit more work, but not as much as you might expect.</p>

<h2>User Authorization</h2>

<p>Drupal provides support for permissions. Rails doesn&rsquo;t. However, the Pundit gem makes it pretty easy.</p>

<p>Add pundit to your Gemfile.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'pundit'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Install it.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ bundle install
$ rails g pundit:install
</code></pre>
<p>Include Pundit in your application controller.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ApplicationController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActionController</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Pundit</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose we have a Post model and we only want logged-in users to be able to view posts. Let&rsquo;s authorize the post in the controller&rsquo;s show method.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PostsController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">show</span>
    <span class="vi">@post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">authorize</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:id</span><span class="p">])</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Calling authorize will instantiate a post policy with the current user and the post record. It will raise an exception if the show? method returns a false-y value. By simply returning the user, non-logged-in visitors will raise an exception and logged-in users will be able to view the post.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># /app/policies/post_policy.rb</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PostPolicy</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationPolicy</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">show?</span>
    <span class="n">user</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
<h2>Views</h2>

<p>Drupal&rsquo;s Views UI helps create blocks and pages that display certain types of content based on certain criteria. In Drupal, you can create a block that displays the titles of the 5 most recent posts linked to their URLs in minutes. Well, you can do it in Rails, too. Let&rsquo;s add one to our homepage.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">WelcomeController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span>
    <span class="vi">@posts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">last</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre><pre class="highlight erb"><code># app/views/welcome/index.html.erb
<span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="vi">@posts</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">post</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span>
  <span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">link_to</span> <span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">title</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">post</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that Rails doesn&rsquo;t require a ton of code to do some of the things that Drupal can do. Plus, you have control over the code. When you want to do something interesting, you don&rsquo;t have to create a custom module, describe it to Drupal, enable it, and wrestle with multiple &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; to determine where to put your code. Rails provides a clean directory structure and a wide array of classes and helper functions you can leverage to build your app&hellip; without getting in your way!</p>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll consider Ruby on Rails for your next project. I did years ago, and I haven&rsquo;t regretted it.</p>
