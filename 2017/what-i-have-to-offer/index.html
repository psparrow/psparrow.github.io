  <p>Last Update: July 25, 2017</p>
</div>

	<p>I want to wake up everyday, open a text editor, and write or improve code - preferably Ruby code. It&rsquo;s that simple. I&rsquo;d prefer to do this remotely as I like where I live and there are no tech jobs in Rehoboth Beach, DE.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I want to work with companies that value doing things the right way and not just the quickest way. I understand that technical debt is sometimes unavoidable, but it should not be a standard feature because it will need to be paid off eventually.</p>

<p>I want to feel like I&rsquo;m working on something that matters. I can force myself to be interested in any task by treating it as a challenge, but working on something I actually care about would be even better.</p>

<h3>What I Don&rsquo;t Want</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to continue doing work that I find unfulfilling. After more than ten years of web development, I still find myself fielding requests to reset WordPress passwords. I sometimes feel like a qualified auto mechanic working at a car wash.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not me being arrogant. I definitely have as bad a case of impostor syndrome as the next developer. In fact, as soon as I learn something, I feel like it must be easy and everyone else probably already knows it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get strung along by a company that doesn&rsquo;t value my time or their team&rsquo;s time. I put a lot of time and effort into building relationships with my clients. It&rsquo;s very frustrating when it turns out that a company is not serious about their project or about hiring developers.</p>

<h3>What I Have to Offer</h3>

<p>I care about the quality of the work that I produce. I treat software development as a craft. I am always learning, keeping up with the latest trends, and striving to write code that I can be proud to show to others.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m practical. I have learned to not over-architect solutions as I&rsquo;m usually working with clients on very tight budgets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m organized and reliable. My friends call me &ldquo;Vacation Dad&rdquo; because I&rsquo;m always prepared and I always have a plan.</p>

<p>I have a strong interest in object-oriented design. I can put myself in the mindset of a programmer and see how a system can be mapped into a set of objects and how those objects can interact with each other.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m responsible. Although I have not worked on large teams, I have always risen to a leadership role going all the way back to projects in college.</p>

<p>I like teaching. I don&rsquo;t have a ton of experience mentoring junior developers, but I blog often, I wrote a book, and I am currently guiding my wife and my business partner as they learn more about programming.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t hate JavaScript, I just haven&rsquo;t chosen a framework yet. I realize that we are moving towards separate front-end apps and backend APIs. I&rsquo;ve done a little bit of work with Angular, and I&rsquo;m interested in React and Vue. I just haven&rsquo;t done much production work with any of them yet.</p>

<p>I have experience. For the past few years, I have been the sole programmer for a health fair management startup. I helped them grow their Ruby on Rails application by adding an automated test suite, multi-step forms, Stripe, Twilio, and Mandrill integration, and a workflow for vendors to browse, express interest, get approved, and register for health fairs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on other Rails applications including a client management system for a local health department, a college ranking system, a mobile app API with Facebook and Dropbox integration, an employer/candidate matching system, and a watchdog service for application monitoring.</p>

<p>I built a C#.Net application that allows users to interact with water testing equipment via a custom XML-based domain-specific language. It runs on Windows, Linux, and Raspberry Pi. It&rsquo;s currently driving underwater equipment in Japan.</p>

<p>I also worked on multiple Drupal, WordPress, and PHP websites for universities, non-profit organizations, startups, and small businesses.</p>

<h3>That&rsquo;s It!</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s all I want. I want to write solid code for a good company. Now, where can I find one of those?</p>
